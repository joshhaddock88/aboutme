          <h2 id="articleHeader" class="intro">A little bit about me...</h2>
          <p class="intro">My name is Joshua Haddock. I was raised in the Chespeake Bay watershed of <strong>Maryland</strong>. While Maryland is geographicaly a bit of a "no mans land", claimed neither by the North or South, culturally it tends to swing quite Southern. My parents were conservative <strong>Seventh-Day Adventists</strong>, and I was raised in the faith as well. What I remember most were the hot summers, air so moist it was impossible to get dry after a shower. I spent my childhood in the heat, tending to our jungle of a yard or lazing on the water, and when I was old enough I would take a boat out into the Miles River and sometimes as far as the bay, and wouldn't come back in until the sun set. Some of my friends had motor boats, but we had a two seater kayake and a row boat badly in need of a new coat of paint. Those were enough for me. I just liked to feel the rock of slight waves beneath me and hear the water lapping against the sides of my boat wile I sat transfixed by the neverending flow of water. <br /><br /> I'm getting carried away. I do that sometimes when I write. Creative non-fiction and long form personal essays were my focus for much of college, until I switched to playwrighting in my final year. When I graduated school I left the church and moved out West to start a new life, where I became enamored with the culture and frenetic energy of Seattles cocktail dens. I worked in some of the hottest places in Seattle for a few years, but after doing what I had set out to do, and feeling the wear and tear it took on my body, I decided it was time to change course. Covid came and did that for me, and after spending a year unemployed and in isolation I came out on the other side knowing what my next steps were. So here I am now, building the website you're reading now.
