## About Me
This is an about me page. It features a brief bio, a chronology, some fun facts, and a top 10 novels. Upon entering the user participates in a little quiz game to see how much they know about me, and then they're told how well they did and are invited to view the rest of the page to learn more.

**Reflections and Comments**
Today we covered some logical operators and if/else statements. I used those to create a more responsive version of the prompts from day one.
We also learned some basics of CSS and I practiced using blocks and formatting my CSS.
